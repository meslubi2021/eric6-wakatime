## Troubleshooting

First, turn on debug mode in your `~/.wakatime.cfg` file by adding this line:

`debug = true`

Second, in Pymakr/Eric6 go to Settings → Enable expert mode, then add this line to your `~/.config/Pycom/pymakr.ini` file under the `UI` section:

`AdvancedBottomSidebar=true`

Then, restart Eric6/Pymakr and look for error messages in the Log-Viewer tab at the bottom.

Also, tail your `$HOME/.wakatime/wakatime.log` file to debug wakatime cli problems.
